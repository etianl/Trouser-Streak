#gold THE BOOK OF GENESIS|#gold Chapter 1|#green [1:1] In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth,|#green [1:2] the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters.|#green [1:3] Then God said, 'Let there be light'; and there was light.|#green [1:4] And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.|#green [1:5] God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.|#green [1:6] And God said, 'Let there be a dome in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.'|#green [1:7] So God made the dome and separated the waters that were under the dome from the waters that were above the dome. And it was so.|#green [1:8] God called the dome Sky. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.|#green [1:9] And God said, 'Let the waters under the sky be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.'

And God saw that it was good.|#gold Chapter 2|#green [2:1] Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their multitude.|#green [2:2] And on the seventh day God finished the work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all the work that he had done.
