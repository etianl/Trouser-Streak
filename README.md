I want to ask, if a tools screen the first panel "tools" can be implemented, it will floodluckperms, delete MRL, delete shopkeepers on the top part and on the other pannel "grief" and you use the "GUILD ID" to know what server to nuke and and "TOKEN ID" for the bot that has administrator permissions, it will delete all roles, and will flood roles, delete channels, and flood channels again, and it will also give everyone in that discord administrator permissions (This can be toggled off), in the in-game client

so like a discord nuker in game
